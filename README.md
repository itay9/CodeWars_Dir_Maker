# CodeWars_Dir_Maker

## The script creates a diractory , saves the kata link and creates a directory for each language you want to program.

I practiced my coding skills in CodeWars and i got tired of organizing my files, so I made a Python script to help me.

Simply install the libraries and run the CodeWarsDirMaker.bat script (or open it from the command line).

Don't forget to install the BS4 module.

I use python, java, js, and c++, but feel free to add or change the language.

The directories are organized in this order: level > kata (problem) > language and in the Kata folder, the program creates a txt file with the link
