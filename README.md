# CodeWars_Dir_Maker

I practiced my coding skills in CodeWars and i got tired of orginaizing my files, so I made a Python script to help me.

Simply install the libraries and run the CodeWarsDirMaker.bat script (or open from the command line).

Don't forget to install the BS4 module.

i use python, java, js, and c++, but feel free to add or change the language.

The directories are organized in this order: level > kata (problem) > language
